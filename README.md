<h2>👨‍💻 Who I Am</h2>
<p align="justify">
Hello! I'm Anthony, a high school student and a developer with a fervor for AI and voice assistant technologies. I'm on a quest to make tech accessible and simple, driven by curiosity and the thrill of creation.
</p>

<h2>🚀 My Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Jarvis-ChatGPT-VoiceAssistant:</b> An intuitive voice assistant that brings simplicity to complex interactions, powered by GPT-3.5/GPT-4, with features like Spotify integration and weather updates.</li>
<li><b>M.I.L.E.S:</b> My current focus and most ambitious project to date, M.I.L.E.S is 60% complete and challenges me to learn a new programming language for a backend rewrite. It boasts real and well-functioning features like Spotify control and real-time weather updates. While it's a massive undertaking, the features are not just theoretical—they are fully operational and effective.</li>
<li><b>MagicTerminal:</b> A groundbreaking command-line interface for MacOS, integrating GPT-4-Turbo through M.I.L.E.S for natural language processing, simplifying terminal tasks with AI command interpretation, multi-command processing, and broad functionality.
</li>
</ul>
