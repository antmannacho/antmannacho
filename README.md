<h2>👨‍💻 Who I Am</h2>
<p align="justify">
Hello! I'm Anthony, a high school student and a developer with a fervor for AI and voice assistant technologies. I'm on a quest to make tech accessible and simple, driven by curiosity and the thrill of creation.
</p>

<h2>🚀 My Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Jarvis-ChatGPT-VoiceAssistant (No longer maintained):</b> Initially an ambitious project, Jarvis was designed to simplify complex interactions through voice commands. However, it's outdated and no longer maintained, reflecting early experimentation rather than current capabilities.</li>
<li><b>M.I.L.E.S:</b> The pinnacle of my project development, M.I.L.E.S is a significant leap forward in AI processing. It's a cross-platform voice assistant that leverages GPT-4-Turbo for a wide array of functionalities including Spotify control, system volume adjustment, weather searches, and personalized interactions. M.I.L.E.S can adapt its prompt and model, store memories, and even engage in natural conversations. It's designed for both Mac and Windows.</li>
<li><b>MagicTerminal:</b> A groundbreaking command-line interface for MacOS, integrating GPT-4-Turbo through M.I.L.E.S for natural language processing, simplifying terminal tasks with AI command interpretation, multi-command processing, and broad functionality.</li>
</ul>
